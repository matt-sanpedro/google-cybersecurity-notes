# Introduction
- Gain understanding of the CISSP's eight security domains
- Learn primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business
- Explore National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) and risk management

# WEEK 1
### CISSP Security Domains: 1-4

1. __Security Posture__: an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change

2. __Risk Mitigation__: the process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach

3. __Business Continuity__: an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans

4. __Shared Responsibility__: all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security

__Components of IAM__: identification, authentication, authorization, accountability

__Threat__: any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets (ex. social engineering)

__Risk__: anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset

__Low-risk asset__:
information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised (ex. published research data)

__Medium-risk asset__: 
information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations

__High-risk asset__:
information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organizations finances, ongoing operations, or reputation (ex. exposed PII, SPII, or IP)

__Vulnerability__: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat (ex. outdated firewall, people's actions)

__Ransomware__: a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access

__Layers of the web__: surface, deep, dark

__Key impacts__: financial, identity theft, reputation

__NIST's Risk Management Framework (RMF)__:
consists of prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, monitor

### RMF Total of Seven Steps:
1. __Prepare__: activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
2. __Categorize__: used to develop risk management processes and tasks
3. __Select__: choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization
4. __Implement__: implement security and privacy plans for the organization
5. __Access__: determine if established controls are implemented correctly
6. __Authorize__: being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization
7. __Monitor__: be aware of how systems are operating

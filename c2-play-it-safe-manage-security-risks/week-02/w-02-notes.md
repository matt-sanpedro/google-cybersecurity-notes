# WEEK 2
Frameworks and Controls

__Biometrics__: unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity

__Vishing__: the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

__Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)__:
developed by the US government to provide "a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity."

__International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001__:
enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties

__NIST S.P 800-53__: a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government

__NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Five Functions__:
1. Identify
2. Protect
3. Detect
4. Respond
5. Recover

__Identify__: the management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets

__Protect__: the strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats

__Detect__: identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections

__Respond__: making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implment improvements to the security process

__Recover__: the process of returning affected systems back to normal operation

__Open Web Applications Security Project (OWASP)__ security principles include:
- minimize attack surface area
- principle of least privilege (ex. users have least amount of access to perform everyday tasks)
- defense in depth (ex. MFA)
- separation of duties (ex. person should not prepare AND sign check)
- keep security simple
- fix security issues correctly

__Four Additional OWASP Security Principles__:
1. Establish secure defaults: 
- optimal security state of application is also its default state for users
2. Fail securely: 
- when a control fails/stops, it should default to its most secure option
- ex. when firewall fails, close all connections and block all new ones
3. Don't trust sevices: 
- an organization should not explicitly trust their partner's systems are secure
4. Avoid security by obscurity:
- security should rely on reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls

__Security Audit__: a review of an organizations security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations

__Common elements of internal audits__:
- establish scope and goals
- conduct risk assessment
- completing a controls assessment
- assessing compliance
- communicating results

__Scope__: refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit

__Goals__: outline of the organization's security objectives

__Control Categories__:
- administrative controls (ex. policies and procedures)
- technical controls (ex. hardware/software solutions like Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Encryption)
- physical controls (ex. surveillance cameras and locks)

__Control Types__: controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect assets
1. Preventative: designed to prevent incident
2. Corrective: restore an asset after incident
3. Detective: determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress
4. Deterrent: designed to discourage attacks

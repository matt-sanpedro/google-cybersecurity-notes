# WEEK 1
Glossary of terms: csrc.nist.gov/glossary

### Security analyst technical skills
- programming languages
- security information and event management (SIEM) tools
- computer forensics

# WEEK 2
By learning about the evolution of attacks, the ethical hacker is poised to understand future attacks and incidents.

__Phishing__: use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.  
Common types include: 
- business email compromise (BEC)
- spear phishing, whaling, vishing, smishing

__Malware__: software designed to harm devices or networks.
Common types include:
- viruses
- worms
- ransomware
- spyware

__Social Engineering__: manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
Common types include:
- social media phishing
- water hole attack
- USB baiting
- physical social engineering

## The Eight CISSP Security Domains
1. __Security and risk management__: defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and law

2. __Asset security__: secures digital and physical assets.  Also related to storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

3. __Security architecture and engineering__: optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place

4. __Communication and network security__: manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications

5. __Identity and access management__: keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as network/apps

6. __Security assessment and testing__: conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

7. __Security operations__: conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures

8. __Software development security__: uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services

# WEEK 3
Frameworks, controls, and ethics

Purpose of security frameworks: protect PII, secure financial information, identify security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, aligning security with business goals

### Four core components of frameworks:
1. __Goals__: identifying and documenting security goals
2. __Guidelines__: setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. __Processes__: implementing strong security processes
4. __Communication__: monitoring and communicating results

__Security controls__: safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks ensures organizations meet regulatory requirements.
(ex. employee privacy training reduces data breach) 

### __CIA Triad__: a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies
- __Confidentiality__: only authorized users can access specific assets or data (ex. strict access controls)
- __Integrity__: data is correct, authentic, and reliable (ex. encryption implemented to ensure data is not tampered)
- __Availability__: data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it (ex. director has more access than manager)

__NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)__: a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

__Security Frameworks__: guidelines for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy

__Security Ethics__: guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional (ex. access to grant raise shouldn't utilize)

__Ethical Principles in Security__: confidentiality, privacy protections, laws

__Privacy Protection__: safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use (ex. employee information should not be shared)

__Laws__: rules recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity (ex. PII and SPII compliance)

__United States Standpoint on counterattacks__: deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal, you can only defend due to:
1. 1986 - Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
2. 2015 - Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act

__Hacktivist__: a person who hacks to achieve a political goal

__International Court of Justice (ICJ) standpoint on counterattacks__:
- only affect the party that attacked first
- direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop
- does not escalate the situation
- effect can be reversed

# WEEK 4
Cybersecurity Tools - SIEM, Playbooks, Network Protocol Analyzers, Linux OS

__Log__: a record of events that occur within an orgnization's systems

__Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool__:
an application that collects and anlayzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization (ex. Splunk and Chronical)

__Playbook__: a manual that provides details about any operational action (guides analysts before, during, and after a security incident)

__Network Protocol Analyzer (packet sniffer)__:
a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network

__Chain of Custody Playbook__: process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle

__Protecting and Preserving Evidence Playbook__:
process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence

__Order of Volatility__: sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last

__Programming__: used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks

__Linux__: an open-source operating system

__Structured Query Language (SQL)__:
a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database

__Database__: an organized collection of information or data

__Python__: used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy

__Web Vulnerability__: malicious code or behavior used to take advantage of coding flaws in a web application

__Antivirus Software__: software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses (also called anti-malware)

__Intrusion detection system (IDS)__: 
an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.  The system scans and analyzes network packets.

__Encryption__: makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data.  Converts data from plain text to cryptographically encoded format.

__Cryptographic encoding__: converting plain text into secure cipher text.  Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representation to share information.

__Penetration Testing__: act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.
